### Stack
---
a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two
principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the
most recently added element that was not yet removed. The order in which elements come off a
stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (for last in, first out).
