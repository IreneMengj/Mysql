Java Virtual Machine - Runtime environment for java programs (runtime environment for java binary bytecode)<br>
<b>Benefit:</b><br>
<li>Write once, run everywhere</li>
<li>Automatic memory management, garbage collection function</li>

1. JRE (Java Runtime Environment): It includes the JVM along with other libraries and components required to run Java applications. The JRE doesn't include any development tools, and it's meant for end-users who want to run Java programs on their machines.<br>
2. JDK (Java Development Kit): It's a software development kit that includes the JRE and additional tools for developing Java applications. The JDK includes a compiler for converting Java source code into bytecode, along with other tools for debugging, testing, and documentation.<br>
3. To summarize, the JVM is the runtime environment that executes Java code, the JRE is the environment that allows end-users to run Java applications, and the JDK is the software development kit that includes tools for building and debugging Java applications.<br>

<b>1.Program Counter Register</b>:<br>
<b>Definition:</b>To remember the execution address of the next jvm instruction<br>
<b>characteristic</b>
<li>It's thread private</li>是线程私有的
<li>There is no memory overflow</li>

<b>2.Java Virtual Machine Stacks</b>:<br>
The amount of memory that each thread needs to run is called the virtual machine stack. Each stack is made up of multiple stack frames, which corresponds to the amount of memory used for each method call. Each thread can only have one active stack Frame, which corresponds to the method that is currently executing<br>

1. Does garbage collection involve stack memory?<br>
No, garbage collection in Java does not involve stack memory.

In Java, the stack is the portion of memory used for storing method invocations and local variables. Each thread in a Java program has its own stack. The stack is managed automatically by the JVM, and it is typically much smaller than the heap. When a method is called, the JVM allocates a block of memory on the stack to store the method's arguments, local variables, and other data. When the method returns, the memory allocated on the stack is automatically freed.

Garbage collection, on the other hand, is the process of automatically reclaiming unused objects from the heap in order to free up memory. The garbage collector scans the heap for objects that are no longer referenced by any part of the program and frees the memory used by those objects. The garbage collector does not directly manipulate the stack, and it does not reclaim memory used by local variables or method invocations on the stack.

In summary, garbage collection in Java only involves memory management on the heap, and it does not directly involve stack memory.

2. Is larger stack memory allocation better?<br>


4. Are local variables within methods thread-safe?<br>
Local variables within a method are thread-safe if they are not accessed from the action of the method<br>
If a local variable references an object and escapes the scope of the method, you need to consider thread safety<br>

Stack Memory Overflow <br>
1.Excessive stack frames cause stack memory overflow<br>
2.Too large stack frame causes stack memory overflow<br>
While increasing the stack size can prevent stack overflow errors, it can also have negative consequences. Allocating too much memory on the stack can increase the memory usage of a program, which can lead to increased garbage collection overhead and slower performance. In addition, some operating systems may limit the maximum stack size, which can lead to compatibility issues.<br>
3. Are local variables within methods thread-safe?<br>
Local variables within a method are thread-safe if they are not accessed from the action of the method<br>
If a local variable references an object and escapes the scope of the method, you need to consider thread safety<br>


<b>4.Heap</b>:<br>
<b>4.1. definition</b>: With the new keyword, objects are created using heap memory<br>
<b>characteristic</b><br>
It is thread-shared, and the objects in the heap need to be thread-safe<br>
There is a garbage collection mechanism<br>
<b>4.2. Heap memory overflow</b><br>
In the context of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), heap memory overflow refers to the situation when a Java program tries to allocate more memory on the heap than is available.

The heap is the portion of memory used by the JVM to store Java objects created by a program at runtime. When a Java program requests memory allocation on the heap using the "new" keyword or through other object creation mechanisms, the JVM will try to allocate memory from the heap space.

If the JVM cannot find enough contiguous free space in the heap to satisfy the allocation request, it will throw an OutOfMemoryError. This can happen if the program has a memory leak or if it simply allocates more memory than the available heap space.

Heap memory overflow in the JVM can cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably. To prevent this error, developers can optimize their code to minimize memory usage and use tools like profilers and memory analyzers to detect and fix memory leaks. The JVM also provides several command-line options that can be used to adjust the heap size and allocation parameters to better suit the needs of the program.<br>


<b>5.Method Area</b><br>
The method area, also known as the permanent generation (PermGen), is a region of memory in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) where class definitions, static variables, and method code are stored. It is a part of the JVM's heap, which is the region of memory where objects are allocated.

When a Java program is executed, the JVM loads the class definitions into the method area. This includes the bytecode instructions that make up the methods of the classes, as well as any static variables or constants defined in the classes. The method area is also responsible for storing metadata about the loaded classes, such as the names of the classes and their methods.

The method area is considered to be a non-heap memory area because it is not used for storing Java objects created at runtime. The memory in the method area is allocated by the JVM at startup and is used throughout the lifetime of the program. However, in Java 8 and later versions, the PermGen has been removed and its functionality has been moved to the native heap area.

<b>Run time constant pool</b><br>
A constant pool is a table that virtual machine instructions use to find the class name, method name, parameter type, literals, and so on. The constant pool is in the *.class file. When the class is loaded, its constant pool information is put into the run time constant pool and the symbolic address in it is changed to the real address<br>
