### Distributed Systems
---
###### Definition. 
- Definition 1: A distributed system is a collection of autonomous hosts that are
connected through a computer network.   
Each host executes components and operates a distribution middleware,
which enables the components to coordinate their activities in such a way
that users perceive the system as a single, integrated computing facility.   
- Definition 2: A distributed system is one in which components located at networked computers
communicate and coordinate their actions only by passing messages.
