### Distributed Systems
---
###### Definition. 
- Definition 1: A distributed system is a collection of autonomous hosts that are
connected through a computer network.   
Each host executes components and operates a distribution middleware,
which enables the components to coordinate their activities in such a way
that users perceive the system as a single, integrated computing facility.   
- Definition 2: A distributed system is one in which components located at networked computers
communicate and coordinate their actions only by passing messages.   
###### Goals
- Resource sharing    
Sharing of hardware and software resources.
- Openness  
Use of equipment and software from different vendors.  
- Concurrency  
Concurrent processing to enhance performance.  
- Scalability  
Increased throughput by adding new resources.  
- Fault tolerance  
The ability to continue in operation after a fault has
occurred.
